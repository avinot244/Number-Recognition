We're building a mlp neural network that aims to predict given a 100x100 image the number that is written on it
Our image is just a 100x100 image with pixel that is either white (0) or black (1).

We will treat this problem as a multi-label classification problem. In fact for the output layer we will have
an input size of 10 where on each element we will have a probability that the ith element is i

Given the problem we will have an input layer of 100x100 = 10000 size and an output layer of size 10.

For the training and the test it would be nice that it's not the same people that have 
drawned numbers in the test set and training set.
